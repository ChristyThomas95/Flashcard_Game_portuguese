# Flashcard_Game_portuguese
This application helps users learn the most common 200 words in Portuguese. The shown words are randomized. However, if the user knows the word, they can press the red cross button, and it will show the English translation for it. In addition, that word will be saved into a new file for future learning. So that every time the user reruns the program, it will load from the newly created file, which consists of the words to learn.
